# UP
One click package updater for LaZY peoples.

# Simple but Useful but also Useless and Efficient!
I know always it is lazy to type this specific command :

    sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y

Imagine You missed one letter and got Syntax Error. Sheesh! That's awful!
<br>But this make your life better than ever. Because it saves time!
<br>It also maximises your laziness!

# So What's UP?
If somebody asks you "What's UP?", What should we say?<br>
Ovbiously, We can proudly say : 

"UP is a the most world's useless program that makes you typing update command more efficient by creating a shortcut to the update command so that ya'll lazy nixxas don't have to press bunch of baCKsPaCEs again."

# Well, ok. so how do I install and use it?
Usually it takes 10~20 Seconds typing the update command. <br>
Aaaand it takes about a minute to install UP. <br>
So I don't recommend you to install this. <br>
Also why are you reading this useless shit? It takes almost 2-3 minutes lmao.You could just go and type the command in that time.
But if you still want, I won't bother you. So go ahead and try to save the time by spending MORE TIME!
